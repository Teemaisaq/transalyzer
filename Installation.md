First download the latest release and unzip it into a directory on your hard drive.

Make sure that the folder containing all of the Matlab scripts is in the Matlab path. Go to the **File Menu -> Set Path**. Click **Add with Subfolders...** and select the proper folder and then **Save**.

Please download and install [export\_fig](http://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig) to ensure proper export of figures. The export\_fig dependencies must also be installed ([ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com) and [pdftops](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf)) since vector formats (eps and pdf) are used.

All scripts assume a period is used as a decimal separator. If your computer uses a comma, then you should either convert your data or switch your computer's settings to use a period instead.
